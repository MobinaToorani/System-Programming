#1. Get a partner. Try to access one of your partner's directoeis using ls. What happens?

I am able to enter the directory and view the files.

#2. Both you and your partner change permissions on one of your existing directories. What do yo have to do to allow your partner to see the contents of your directories, and visa-versa?



#3 Atempt to delete a file that your partner created in your directory. How is that working for you?
